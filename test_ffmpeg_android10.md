# Android 10+ FFmpeg Execution Issue

## Problem
Android 10 (API 29) and later enforces W^X (Write XOR Execute) policy, preventing execution of binaries from the app's data directory (`/data/data/com.example.app/files/`).

## Current Status
- FFmpeg binary successfully built (13MB static binary for arm64-v8a)
- Binary extracts correctly to app files directory
- Execution fails with "Permission denied" on Android 10+

## Solutions to Try

### 1. Use Code Cache Directory (Implemented)
The code now tries to extract to `context.codeCacheDir` which sometimes allows execution.

### 2. Use a Pre-built Library Solution
Consider using mobile-ffmpeg or ffmpeg-kit libraries which handle this properly:
```gradle
implementation 'com.arthenica:ffmpeg-kit-full:5.1'
```

### 3. Build as JNI Library
Convert FFmpeg to a proper JNI library that can be loaded with `System.loadLibrary()`.

### 4. Target Lower API Level (Temporary)
In your app's build.gradle, temporarily target API 28:
```gradle
android {
    compileSdk 34
    
    defaultConfig {
        targetSdkVersion 28  // Temporarily target pre-Android 10
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## Recommendation
For production apps, use ffmpeg-kit library which handles all these issues:
```kotlin
import com.arthenica.ffmpegkit.FFmpegKit

// Execute FFmpeg command
FFmpegKit.execute("-version")
```

## Testing
1. Clean and rebuild the app
2. Test on Android 9 device (should work)
3. Test on Android 10+ device (may still fail due to W^X)

The code cache directory approach might work on some devices but not all. The most reliable solution is to use ffmpeg-kit or build FFmpeg as a proper JNI library.
